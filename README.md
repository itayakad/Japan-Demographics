# JapanDemographics
This repository contains the code and data for an in-class project that analyzes the changing demographics of Japan from the early 1900s to the present day using R. The project focuses on various demographic metrics, with a key highlight being the increasing age at which Japanese mothers are having their first child. This significant finding, along with others, is detailed in the accompanying article titled "Japan's Moms Are Getting Older!" The repository includes R scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization, along with the datasets used in the study.
